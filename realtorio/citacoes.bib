abstract = {The partition function of a two-dimensional "ferro- magnetic" with scalar "spins" (Ising model) is computed rigorously for the case of vanishing field. The eigenwert problem involved in the corresponding computation for a 1ong strip crystal of finite width (n atoms), joined straight to itself around a cylinder, is solved by direct product decomposition; in the special case n = $\sim$ an integral replaces a sum. The choice of different interaction energies (&J, &J') in the (01) and (10) directions does not complicate the problem. The two-way infinite crystal has an order-disorder transition at a temperature by the condition sinh(2 J/kT, ) sinh(2 J'/kT, ) = 1.},

@article{wl2004,
abstract = {We describe a Monte Carlo algorithm for doing simulations in classical statistical physics in a different way. Instead of sampling the probability distribution at a fixed temperature, a random walk is performed in energy space to extract an estimate for the density of states. The probability can be computed at any temperature by weighting the density of states by the appropriate Boltzmann factor. Thermodynamic properties can be determined from suitable derivatives of the partition function and, unlike "standard" methods, the free energy and entropy can also be computed directly. To demonstrate the simplicity and power of the algorithm, we apply it to models exhibiting first-order or second-order phase transitions. &copy;2004 American Association of Physics Teachers.},

abstract = {This new and updated edition deals with all aspects of Monte Carlo simulation of complex physical systems encountered in condensed-matter physics, statistical mechanics, and related fields. After briefly recalling essential background in statistical mechanics and probability theory, it gives a succinct overview of simple sampling methods. The concepts behind the simulation algorithms are explained comprehensively, as are the techniques for efficient evaluation of system configurations generated by simulation. It contains many applications, examples, and exercises to help the reader and provides many new references to more specialized literature. This edition includes a brief overview of other methods of computer simulation and an outlook for the use of Monte Carlo simulations in disciplines beyond physics. This is an excellent guide for graduate students and researchers who use computer simulations in their research. It can be used as a textbook for graduate courses on computer simulations in physics and related disciplines.},
